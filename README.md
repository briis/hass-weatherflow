The WeatherFlow integration adds support for retrieving weather data from a Personal Weatherstation manufactured by [WeatherFlow](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) using a [REST API](https://weatherflow.github.io/Tempest/api/swagger/).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

* Weather
  * Two Weather entities will be created per station. One showing an hour-based forecast and one showing a day based forecast.
* Sensor
  * A whole range of individual sensors will be available. for a complete list of the sensors, see the list below.
* Binary Sensor
  * A few binary sensors will be available, that can be used to trigger automations, if f.ex. it starts raining.

## Installation

### HACS installation

This Integration is part of the default HACS store. Search for *weatherflow weather* under *Integrations* and install from there. After the installation of the files, you must restart Home Assistant, or else you will not be able to add WeatherFlow Weather from the Integration Page.

If you are not familiar with HACS, or haven't installed it, I would recommend to [look through the HACS documentation](https://hacs.xyz/), before continuing. Even though you can install the Integration manually, I would recommend using HACS, as you would always be reminded when a new release is published.

### Manual installation

To add WeatherFlow to your installation, create this folder structure in your /config directory:

`custom_components/weatherflow`.

Then drop the following files into that folder:

```yaml
__init__.py
binary_sensor.py
config_flow.py
const.py
entity.py
manifest.json
models.py
sensor.py
weather.py
translation (Directory with all files)
```

## Configuration
To add WeatherFlow Weather to your installation, do the following:
- Go to *Configuration* and *Integrations*
- Click the `+ ADD INTEGRATION` button in the lower right corner.
- Search for WeatherFlow and click the integration.
- When loaded, there will be a configuration box, where you must enter your *Station ID* and a *Personal Token* to get access to your data. When entered click *Submit* and the Integration will load all the entities.

If you want to change the update frequencies for the realtime data and forecast data, this can be done by clicking `CONFIGURE` in the lower left corner of the WeatherFlow integration..

You can configure more than 1 instance of the Integration by using a different Station ID.

### Token for WeatherFlow
The WeatherFlow REST API requires a Token. Please [login with your account](https://tempestwx.com/settings/tokens) and create the token. Go to Settings and choose Data Authorizations (almost at the bottom). Create a personal access token and use that as Token (API key).

**Please Note**: The Token you create here will ONLY work with Stations that are registered under the same Login.

### Station ID
Each WeatherFlow Station you setup, will get a unique Station ID, this id is needed during configuration. To get your Station ID, [login with your account](https://tempestwx.com/settings/stations/), select the station on the list, and then click *Status*. Here you will find your Station ID.

## Available Sensors

Here is the list of sensors that the program generates. Calculated Sensor means, if No, then data comes directly from the Weather Station, if yes, it is a sensor that is derived from some of the other sensors. Not all sensors show up on all installations. It depends on the Physical Device you have and where in the world your station is located.

All entities are prefixed with `weatherflow_` and names are prefixed with `Weatherflow`

## Available Binary Sensors

Here is the list of binary sensors that the program generates. These sensors are all calculated based on values from other sensors

All entities are prefixed with `weatherflow_` and names are prefixed with `Weatherflow`

| Sensor ID   | Name   | Description   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is_freezing | Is Freezing | Is the Temperature below freezing point |
| is_lightning | Is Lightning | Has lighning strikes occured within the last minute |
| is_raining | Is Raining | Is it raining outside |

## Available Weather Entities

Here is the list of Weather Entities that the program generates. With the exception of the condition state and the icon, the values for the current condition are equal to the Sensor values, so the Weather entity displayes realtime values and the forecast for either the next days or the next hours. Both entities are installed.

All entities are prefixed with `weatherflow_` and names are prefixed with `Weatherflow`

| Sensor ID   | Name   | Description   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| day_based_forecast | Day Based Forecast | A weather entity with Forecast for today and the next 9 days |
| hourly_based_forecast | Hourly Based Forecast | A weather entity with Forecast for the next 48 hours |

## Enable Debug Logging

If logs are needed for debugging or reporting an issue, use the following configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  default: error
  logs:
    pyweatherflowrest: debug
    custom_components.weatherflow: debug
```

## CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT AND DEVELOPING WITH A DEVCONTAINER

### Integration

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Open in VSCode and choose to open in devcontainer. Must have VSCode devcontainer prerequisites.
3. Run the command container start from VSCode terminal
4. A fresh Home Assistant test instance will install and will eventually be running on port 9124 with this integration running
5. When the container is running, go to http://localhost:9124 and the add WeatherFlow Weather from the Integration Page.

### Frontend

There are some sensors in this integration that provides a text as state which is not covered by the core Frontend translation. Example: `sensor.weatherflow_pressure_tend`, `sensor.weatherflow_uv_description` and `sensor.weatherflow_beaufort_description`.

As default the text in the Frontend is displayed in english if your language is not present in this integration, but if you want to help translate these texts into a new language, please do the following:
- Go to the `translations` directory under `custom_components/weatherflow` and copy the file `sensor.en.json` to `sensor.YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE.json` in a directory on your computer.
- Edit the file and change all the descriptions to your language.
- Make a Pull request in this Github and attach your new file.

The same procedure applies for the Configuration flow, follow the above procedure, just copy `en.json` to `YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE.json`.
